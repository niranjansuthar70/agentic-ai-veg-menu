// prompt = """
//     Analyze the provided restaurant menu image. Your task is to extract ONLY the vegetarian dishes and their corresponding prices.

//     Return the output as a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text or markdown formatting before or after the JSON block.

//     The JSON object should have a single top-level key: "vegetarian_dishes".
//     The value of "vegetarian_dishes" should be an array of objects.
//     Each object in the array should represent a vegetarian dish and have the following two keys:
//     1. "name": The name of the dish (string).
//     2. "price": The price of the dish (string).

//     - If a dish is explicitly vegetarian (e.g., "Veg Pulao"), include it.
//     - If an item is a vegetarian component within a non-vegetarian meal (like "Veg Rayta Special" in a "Chicken Thali"), list it. For its price, you can state "Part of Thali".
//     - Do not include any non-vegetarian items like chicken, mutton, or egg dishes.
//     - If there are no vegetarian dishes at all, return an empty array for the "vegetarian_dishes" key.
//     """
